      "description": "As an intern at MTA, I developed an API that retrieves historical, spatial bus data from various, internal databases.

Based on a given bus route and date, the app enables the user to view the data based on the layers of interest, bus direction, and time range. It also allows to visualize data based on a specific trip.",
